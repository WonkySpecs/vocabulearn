# Vocabulearn

Vocabulearn is a WIP application for learning, storing, and revising foreign language vocabulary.

## Roadmap

Vocabulearn is planned to include (approximately-ish in order, maybe):

 - Storing and browsing words and their translations
 - Tagging words with:
   - 'Word areas' ie. 'colour', 'number', 'animal'
   - 'Word type' ie. 'verb', 'noun', 'connective'
   - 'Learning groups' - select specific groups of words to learn together
 - Learning quizzes - uni or bidirectional
 - Support for both transliterated and original alphabets
 - Spaced repetition learning for new words, and tracking of (self recorded?) confidence levels
 - A GUI
